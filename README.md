## 📌 Project Overview

This is a Python-based Caesar Cipher tool built as part of my internship at **SkillCraft Technology**. It demonstrates classical encryption logic, brute-force decryption, and the basics of cryptography using clean, readable code.

The program allows users to:

- 🔐 Encrypt a message using a key
- 🔓 Decrypt a message with a known key
- 🕵️ Crack a message using brute-force when the key is unknown

## 🧠 Learning Outcomes

- Understood how classical substitution ciphers work
- Gained hands-on experience writing encryption/decryption logic
- Practiced brute-force techniques in ethical hacking
- Improved Python coding structure, logic, and user interaction
